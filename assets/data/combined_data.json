The sauce should register about 170 degrees F on a thermometer and still be smooth. Strain into a bowl, stir in the vanilla and allow to cool slightly before refrigerating."

      "I have made this recipe many times to get rave reviews and licked the platter clean! The only alteration I make is slow-cook the ribs at 325 degrees for about 3 hrs. This seems to allow the flavors more time to permeate the meat plus makes for ribs which melt in your mouth.",
      "Now I know why this is so popular. These are simply terrific. I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions: slow cooked @ 325 for 3 hours and I did not use white sugar, I used 1/4 cup honey instead. I used some of the sweetness of the brown sugar and honey. Thank you Beverly.",
      "Excellent ribs. We like our ribs sweet & sticky and falling off the bones. I couldn't find Old Bay Seasoning (I'm from Canada) so I made my own from a recipe I found on the internet. I only used 1/2 the amount of garlic powder, omitted the white sugar and cooked for 3 hours in the oven very slow. Served them with baked potato and baked squash with a green salad to start.",
      "I'll join the bandwagon--these are great! I also cooked them very slow--a little over 3 hours at 300°. Don't usually use Old Bay Seasoning so did some research and found a copycat recipe on foodtv.com and made a small amount of 'Old Bay' just for this.",
      "Great recipe, this was the first time I ever made ribs. I cooked them in the crockpot, on low for about 4 hours and on high for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours and they still came out very tender and juicy. This recipe is a keeper. UPDATE: 2nd time I'm using this recipe with 5",
      "Delicious slow cooked. We reheated the left overs in the oven, and they were as good as the first time. We put the left over sauce in jars and froze it, to recycle, as it uses a lot of honey and bbq sauce, and it seems a waste to just throw it out.",
      "I am not a BBQ fan, but this recipe really turn me around. I left the recipe intact, but used 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, omitted the white sugar and cooked for half an hour longer (still cover). The leftover sauce smell wonderful, so I save it.",
      "This was fantastic. I cooked it for 2 1/2 hours at 325 degrees and they were fall off the bone tender. There were three of us and we ate, and ate and ate....delish! Thanks for sharing too."
