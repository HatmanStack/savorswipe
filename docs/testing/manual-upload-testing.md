## Section 3: Performance Benchmarks

These benchmarks help identify performance regressions:

| Scenario | Target Time | Max Acceptable | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| 1 image | < 10s | 15s | OCR + embedding + image search |
| 5 images | < 30s | 45s | Parallel processing with 3 workers |
| 10 images | < 60s | 90s | May hit Lambda concurrency limits |
| 15 images | < 90s | 120s | Close to Lambda timeout threshold |
| PDF (3 recipes) | < 25s | 40s | Includes multi-recipe extraction |
| Duplicate check | < 10s | 15s | Fast similarity comparison |

**If times exceed "Max Acceptable":**
- Check Lambda logs for errors
- Verify OpenAI API response times
- Check S3 upload speeds
- Review network connectivity

---

## Section 4: Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Empty/Invalid Files
**Test**: Upload a corrupt image or empty PDF
**Expected**: Error message "Invalid file format" or "OCR failed"

### Edge Case 2: OCR Failure
**Test**: Upload an image with no text or unreadable text
**Expected**: Error indicating OCR couldn't extract recipe data

### Edge Case 3: All Failures Scenario
**Test**: Upload 5 files that all fail (corrupted, duplicates, etc.)
**Expected**: Toast: "0 of 5 recipes added. Tap to view 5 errors."

### Edge Case 4: Concurrent Uploads
**Test**: Tap "Upload" on two different devices simultaneously
**Expected**: Job queue handles both, processes sequentially

### Edge Case 5: Very Large Image
**Test**: Upload a 20MB high-resolution image
**Expected**: Processing may take longer, but should complete or fail gracefully

### Edge Case 6: App Backgrounding
**Test**: Upload 10 files, then immediately background the app
**Expected**: Upload continues in background, toast appears when app reopened

### Edge Case 7: Mixed Success/Failure
**Test**: Upload batch with some valid, some corrupt files
**Expected**: Valid files succeed, corrupt files fail with specific errors

---

## Section 5: Error Detail Testing

### Error Modal Display
1. Upload a batch with at least 2 failures
2. Wait for completion toast
3. **Tap the toast notification**
4. Verify Error Detail Modal opens

### Error Modal Content
Verify the modal shows:
- [ ] Title: "Upload Errors"
- [ ] Clear list of failed files
- [ ] Each error shows:
  - File number (e.g., "File 3")
  - Recipe title (if extracted)
  - Reason for failure
- [ ] Close button works
- [ ] Modal scrollable for many errors

### Error Modal Interaction
- [ ] Tapping outside modal doesn't close it
- [ ] Close button closes modal
- [ ] Errors are clearly readable
- [ ] No truncated messages

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Common Commands
```bash
# Start app
npm start

# Clear cache
npm start -- --reset-cache

# View logs
npx expo start --android --no-dev --minify
```

### Expected Toast Messages
- Success (all): "All X recipes added successfully!"
- Success (partial): "X of Y recipes added. Tap to view Z errors."
- Failure (all): "0 of X recipes added. Tap to view X errors."
- Duplicate: "0 of 1 recipes added. Tap to view 1 error."
- Network error: "Upload failed"

### Troubleshooting
- **No toast appears**: Check Lambda logs, verify network connection
- **OCR fails**: Ensure image has clear, readable text
- **Duplicate not detected**: Check embedding similarity threshold (0.85)
- **Queue injection fails**: Verify RecipeContext updates, check image fetching
- **Performance slow**: Check OpenAI API status, Lambda cold starts
